This software does DMA output to a DZ and executes on
a KMC11-A.  Installation procedure follows:

1) Install kmc program object in /lib:
	/lib/cpp dza.s | kas -o /lib/dzkmc.o 
2) Install kmc load shell in /etc:
	cp dzkload /etc
3) Update /etc/rc to call dzkload for
	multi-user,
	power-fail.
  For example, add 
	/etc/dzkload /dev/kmc0
4) Make nodes for kmc and dz lines
	mknod /dev/kmc0 c X 0
	mknod /dev/tty?? c Y Z
The high-order two bits of the eight-bit minor device number for each
dz line specify the kmc (minor device number) that controls the dz
associated with that line.  For example
	mknod /dev/tty?? c Y 0240
specifies the first line on the fifth dz, to be controlled by the kmc
with minor device number 2.  The dz number is controlled by the order of
appearance in the file which describes the configuration.
The first four dz's must be associated  with one kmc and the next four
dz's must be associated with a differented kmc.
