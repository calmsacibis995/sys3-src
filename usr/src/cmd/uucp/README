						November 10, 1979
	The distributed uucp sources fit BOTH PDP/11's and VAXs.
A substantial number of minor changes were made to ``uucp''
by Dave Nowitz and Her-daw Che during May thru November, 1979.
Most of the changes are relatively benign. See the file CHANGES
for a list of what has been done.
In particular, a command called 'uustat' is included to
provide the uucp status inquiry and job control.
Another command 'uusub' is also provided to monitor
the uucp 'subnetwork'.
You can turn these features on or off via switches
'UUSTAT' and 'UUSUB' defined in 'uucp.h'.
For more detail, see "Uustat - A UUCp Status Inquiry Program",

			PWB 1.2 SYSTEMS
        There is a new stockroom category, called ``pwbuucp'', (made March 21)
which gives additional information regarding installing uucp on PWB 1.2 
systems.  This information is by courtesy of Brian Redman.

		***	UUCP ADMINISTRATORS LIST         ***
	We are in the process of compiling an up to date Uucp Administrators
List. This list will be used to keep users abreast of new updates, releases,
password & phone number changes ... etc., via uucp, of course. Please mail
the following information to pwba!lat:      
1) Administrator's name
2) Mailing address and phone number
3) System name(s) & description
e.g.  mhtsa      Unix Support Group 11/70a .
4) Your login name (for mail)
			GENERAL  INSTRUCTIONS
	UUCP installators should read the two papers (by Dave Nowitz)
distributed with the uucp sources.
Before running "uucp", you should change the define for "MYNAME"
in "uucp.h" to whoever you are, and recompile.
As delivered, "uucp" thinks that it is running on the ``mhtsa'' system.
        Since all ACUs are not created equal, the last character which must
be sent to the ACU may differ on your system.  The value "ACULAST" in
"uucp.h" should be modified if necessary.
        To run successfully you will need to provide working
versions of the following files:
  L-devices     entries for call-units and hard-wired connections
  L-dialcodes   decodes abbreviations occurring in L.sys
  L.sys         pertinent details about other systems that you
                may call, as the result of prior agreement.
  USERFILE      user accessibility information

The information in these files is specific to each installation.
The versions supplied are arbitrarily modified versions of files
used on the mhtsa machine, and are provided only as examples.

        As delivered, "uucp" is set up to use the following
directories (contrary to some documentation):

        /usr/src/cmd/uucp       source files
        /usr/lib/uucp           executable programs and data files
        /usr/spool/uucp         work-in-progress
        /usr/lib/uucp/.XQTDIR      work area for "uuxqt"
        /usr/spool/uucppublic   uucp public directory


NOTE - some recent changes have moved some of the directories.
The names appear in uucp.h and the "uucp.mk" file.
(SPOOL, XQTDIR, PUBDIR, INSDIR, THISDIR)
The login directory for the uucp login(s) should be the PUBDIR
directory.

	Note also that there is an array called "Cmds" in the file
"uuxqt.c" which names the commands which may be executed at
the request of a remote user, via "uux". You will most probably
wish to modify the initialization of this array, to reflect the
commands you are willing to allow on your system.

	The ``mail'' command has been modified, so that it may
only be used to send mail, when it is invoked under a name beginning
with 'r'. (In the receive mode, it can be used to invoke a shell,
thus creating a potential security hole.)
When sending mail to a remote site, ``mail'' invokes the ``rmail''
command at the remote site. Hence you should create an ``rmail''
command by linking to ``/bin/mail", and ensure that ``Cmds''
contains an entry for ``rmail'', but not ``mail''.

        Note that other systems which may contact you via "uucp"
will have to login using information that you supply. When UNIX/TS and
UNIX/RT are delivered there is a user "uucp" (with no initial password) 
whose default shell is (and must be) "/usr/lib/uucp/uucico". If you
wish to use "uucp" to contact other systems you will need to
obtain username and password information from them in advance and
to store this in "L.sys".  Since the file "L.sys" contains
sensitive information about how to access other systems which are
willing to converse with you, it is important that the "L.sys"
file be properly protected. You will find that ensuring a high
level of protection is not a trivial task. As a minimum you will
need to set correctly the permissions on the file itself, its
parent directory and every executable "set-uid-to-root" file in
your whole system ... and then ensure that the root password is
secure ... as a bare minimum.

        The programs "uuclean" and "uulog" are provided for
housekeeping.  These should be run frequently, e.g. by "cron".
Prototypes of procedures that may be run by "cron" are provided
here as the files "uudemon.*".  Note also that "uudemon.hr"
starts up "uucico" to initiate transfers that have been delayed
for some reason, or to poll passive systems for work.
