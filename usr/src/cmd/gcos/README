Steps to install files in gcos:

1)  Edit the file gcos.h in both directory "spoolers" and
	directory "daemons", defining the character strings PHONE_ID
	and FGET_ID as the 2-character station id for GCOS that
	has been assigned to your machine.  Check the last 8
	lines of the header file gcos.h for the definitions
	of DEVDU, DEVDN, and NUMBERS, and change them if necessary,
	giving the proper device names for the dataphone (or vpm)
	and acu devices, and the appropriate phone numbers
	for calling GCOS.

2)  Copy the file gerts.c into the directory daemons from
	the appropriate subdirectory daemons/du, daemons/kmc1,
	or daemons/kmc2, depending on whether you will be
	using a du or KMC device.

3)  Create the directory /usr/spool/dpd, writeable by everyone.

4)  Create the file /usr/spool/dpd/errors, writeable by everyone,
	if you want a record of the transactions of dpd and fget.demon.

5)  Edit the makefile gcos.mk to change the first dependency
	line from
		all:
	to
		all:	spoolers daemons
	and remove the next line
			echo cat /usr/src/cmd/gcos/README

6)  As user "daemon" and group "bin", execute the makefile:
		make -f gcos.mk install
    This should compile and install all the commands
	(dpr, gcat, fget and fsend) into /usr/bin,
	and all the daemons (dpd and fget.demon) into /usr/lib,
	if they are not found elsewhere on your system.

7)  Check to be sure that /usr/lib/dpd
	is mode 4755 (set-user-id), and is owned by daemon.

8)  Add the following code to /etc/rc (if it is not already there):
		rm -f /usr/spool/dpd/lock /usr/spool/dpd/glock
		/usr/lib/dpd

9)  Add an entry to crontab to initiate fget.demon periodically.
	e.g. every 15 minutes:
		5,20,35,50  *  *  *  *  /usr/lib/fget.demon 20


FOR KMC USERS:

The KMC script must be compiled and loaded into the KMC.
	The appropriate files are all in subdirectory daemons/kmc1
	or daemons/kmc2, depending on whether the KMC will
	be used merely to simulate a du, (daemons/kmc1), or
	to supply most of the GRTS protocol (daemons/kmc2).
	The recommended script is the one in daemons/kmc2.
	Change to appropriate subdirectory.

a)  For the daemons, copy the file gerts.c into the directory
	daemons, (see step 2 above), and complete steps 1-9 above.

Then, depending on whether your KMC is a model "A" or "B",
	do the following:

b)  Compile KMC script and save object in vpmdpd.o:

	vpmc -m -i bisynca -o vpmdpd.o kmc.v	for KMC/A
		or
	vpmc -m -o vpmdpd.o kmc.v		for KMC/B

c)  Load script into KMC:

	/etc/vpmstarta /dev/kmc? 6 vpmdpd.o	for KMC/A
		or
	/etc/vpmstart /dev/kmc? 6 vpmdpd.o	for KMC/B

	where "/dev/kmc?" is the name of the KMC device to be used
	by dpd.

d)  To automatically load the KMC at system start-up time:

	1)  Move vpmdpd.o to /lib/vpmdpd.o

	2)  Create the automatic load file, /etc/dpdload,
		by editing the file dpdload in the current
		subdirectory so that the first line is either

		kas -d /dev/kmc? <<!		for KMC/A
			or
		kasb -d /dev/kmc? <<!		for KMC/B

		Also modify the string "kmc?" in both the
		first and last lines of dpdload to be the name
		of the KMC device to be used by dpd, as in c) above.
		Move this file to /etc/dpdload.

	3)  Add the following line to /etc/rc:

		/etc/dpdload
